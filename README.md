Dataset Description

The dataset contains 30 columns, including:

•	Transaction Details: Transaction ID, Date, Amount, Payment Type
•	Customer Demographics: Customer ID, Age, Gender, Location
•	Product Information: Product ID, Category, Price, Discount
•	Purchase Behavior: Frequency of purchases, Total spend, Returns

Key Analysis & Methodologies

1. Data Preprocessing

	•	Handled missing values and duplicates
	•	Fixed inconsistent formats (e.g., date, price)
	•	Detected and removed outliers

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

	•	Identified top-selling products & categories
	•	Analyzed sales trends over time
	•	Examined customer demographics
	•	Measured product return rates
